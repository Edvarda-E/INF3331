# Assignment 3
This is the directory for assignment 3, done by Edvarda Eriksen (ererikse).

## 3.1 - Wordcount
Running the script
```
$ chmod a+x wc.py
$ ./wc.py ./example.txt
```

**Additional decisions**
* Currently including `\n` in the character count, resulting in more characters than "conventional" character trackers.
* Empty lines at the end of a file does not count
